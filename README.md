# Bird Classifier
:triumph: :triumph:  :triumph: Ongoing..... :triumph: :triumph: :triumph:

# Why?
- This Project is part of adventure of me and my friend trying to explore ML , API 
- To create a platform for detecting any kind of bird that is known to man
- To try creating a platform that end-user could train YOLOv5's model to detect bird with simple-to-use API
- To create an endpoint for detecting bird with one simple script

# Developer's Note
- Now working on writing web scraping scripts that could be used on CMD 
- Exploring ideas and structures to make Bird_Classifier one complete platform on-the-go
- GCP is very useful for deployment
- I'm confident enough that Docker Container is not so hard to use
