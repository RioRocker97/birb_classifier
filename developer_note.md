# Developer's Note
- Now working on writing web scraping scripts that could be used on CMD
- Exploring ideas and structures to make Bird_Classifier one complete platform on-the-go
- GCP is very useful for deployment
- I'm confident enough that Docker Container is not so hard to use
- How to use Pool and Thread ??? Need to try them both for increasing performance
- just realized that GCP's cloud run and cloud function can handle concurrency
