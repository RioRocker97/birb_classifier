# Developer's Note
- Now working on writing web scraping scripts that could be used on CMD
- Exploring ideas and structures to make Bird_Classifier one complete platform on-the-go
- GCP is very useful for deployment
- I'm confident enough that Docker Container is not so hard to use
- How to use Pool and Thread ??? Need to try them both for increasing performance

    - running first web scraping script . it's far from perfect but it get the job done . yandex is pretty good but i can find a better way to extract image data from somewhere else . Maybe google ? Bing ? , Image-Data API endpoint ?

    - first gathering is ok . it a little rough and maybe hard to re-use it later . Maybe, try re-writing web scraping script ?
    - building bird_engine now. would be fun
