# Developer's Note
- Now working on writing web scraping scripts that could be used on CMD
- Exploring ideas and structures to make Bird_Classifier one complete platform on-the-go
- GCP is very useful for deployment
- I'm confident enough that Docker Container is not so hard to use
- How to use Pool and Thread ??? Need to try them both for increasing performance
- just realized that GCP's cloud run and cloud function can handle concurrency
- .gitignore > .dockerignore // remember this so i don't have to waste time debugging cloud build AGAIN!!!
    - is this only happened in GCP's cloud run ?
    - why my container can build just fine with .dockerignore included but cloud run can't ???? WTF /??
- problem is fixed ! but this project need more polished (there's something i like to try before going LIVE)
- just found a way to implement openAI's Completion API to make my own chatbot about bird
    - the results are fking shocking. GPT-3 model is getting real human-alike
# Daily Progression

    - running first web scraping script . it's far from perfect but it get the job done . yandex is pretty good but i can find a better way to extract image data from somewhere else . Maybe google ? Bing ? , Image-Data API endpoint ?
- 24/7/2021 
    - first gathering is ok . it a little rough and maybe hard to re-use it later . Maybe, try re-writing web scraping script ?
    - building bird_engine now. would be fun
- 20/8/2021
    - re-construct core code for this project
    - now it is plain ML application without other flexible and shit
    - expected to do good detection and then show result via LINE uOA
- 21/8/2021
    - change development style to test locally then go-live on-cloud when it ready
    - still have no idea how gunicorn calling Webhook.py tho
    - can this container at least handle 100 simultaneous API callings ?
- 25/8/2021
    - modify Flex message template for better result and view
    - found a way to implement openAI's completion API
- 27/8/2021
    - openAI's completion API seem kinda big to be implemented for such a specific task like creating a chatbot . there must be a way to do it right and efficiently
- 28/8/2021
    - chatbot is kinda worked ! but it need to be polished more . some prompt that been feeding to openAI can be hard to interpret sometimes
    - maybe i should try experimenting this prompting techniques a little more
- 29/8/2021
    - sometimes the completion result can be bizzare word or something else entirely unrelated ! don't know why it acted like that tho
    - overall structure is getting complexed . maybe i should try put them all in OOP style
- 2/9/2021
    - sucessfully deployed webhook on-cloud . now it's in beta-stage !
    - will do code clean-up later
